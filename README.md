**Founder & External CTO | Principal Architect**  
Former Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect & App Innovation Lead

I design, build, and operate **production-grade distributed systems** across  
**cloud, hybrid, and fully on-prem environments**.

I work with organizations as an **External CTO / Architecture Board** —  
owning architectural decisions, delivery outcomes, and operational reliability,  
not just providing advice or slideware.

---

## Focus Areas

- Distributed systems & platform architecture
- Kubernetes & internal developer platforms (IDP)
- DevOps & GitOps operating models
- Observability-first design (logs, metrics, traces, SLO/SLI, error budgets)
- Legacy modernization without disrupting production
- Vendor-agnostic, hybrid and on-prem architectures

I am the founder of **TungOps**, a production-first engineering consultancy that
designs, builds, and operates mission-critical systems using a
**Design–Build–Run** delivery model.

## Background (Short)

- **Founder & External CTO — TungOps (2025–Present)**  
  Acting as External CTO / Principal Architect for enterprises facing
  modernization, scalability, reliability, and operational challenges.

- **Cloud Solution Architect & App Innovation Lead — Microsoft (2018–2025)**  
  Led large-scale enterprise modernization programs across Türkiye,
  the Middle East, and Europe; worked directly with CTOs, CIOs, and
  executive leadership teams on platform strategy, operating models,
  and architectural governance.

A key principle throughout my career:  
**Cloud adoption is never a prerequisite for good architecture.**  
Production-grade standards can — and should — exist on-prem.

## Open Source & Engineering Projects

These are **production-oriented tools**, built to solve real operational problems
in enterprise environments.

### Azure DevOps Agent on Kubernetes
