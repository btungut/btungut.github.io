# Who am I ?
Hi everyone! 

My name is Burak Tungut. I'm a developer and currently working at Microsoft as Cloud Solution Architect.

In my position at Microsoft, I have primarily been in leadership of long-term modernization projects. I also try to make an effort to use open-source software and to contribute to it whenever I can.
